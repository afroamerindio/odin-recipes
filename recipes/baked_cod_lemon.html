            <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground pink salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) cod filets</li>
            <li>2 lemons, each cut into 8 thin slices</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil   </li>
            <li>4 sprigs fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>



        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. 
                Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, 
                cutting and mixing as you go. Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika, 
                and mix until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. 
                Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. 
                Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. </li>

        </ol>
