    <h4>Arepas! Have you had them? Let’s talk about what they are. These are a really big deal in my life right now.</h4>
    <p>These gems are South American pockets of fried cornmeal-like dough (harina precocida if you want to get technical) 
        and they’re stuffed with every possible good thing you could ever want stuffed in a pocket of fried cornmeal-like dough. 
        You most commonly find them being made in Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Panama. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups precooked cornmeal*</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>Oil for pan frying (you only need a tiny ammount)</li>



        </ul>
    <h3>Filling ideas</h3>
    <p>Arepas are very vesatile when it comes to what to fill them with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fried eggs and Avocados</li>
        <li>Carnitas (personal fave!) or Chipotle Shredded Chicken</li>
        <li>Magic Green Sauce or other sauce (umm, what other sauce would there be?)</li>
        <li>Black beans</li>
        <li>sweet potatoes, sliced into thin pieces and sautéed in olive oil and salt until softened</li>
        <li>red onions (pickled? yum)</li>
        <li>Cotija cheese </li>
        <li>Or all of the above </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>The procces of making arepas slightly changes from country to country and region to region. 
        Below is the most common method:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Combine your ingredients</strong>: Mix the precooked cornmeal and the salt. 
            Add the water (warm water) and whisk remove any lumps, then stir until combined. Use your hands mix and get a consistent dough. 
            Let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the arepas</strong>: Using your hands, divide the dough into 8 pieces. 
            Roll each piece into a ball and flatten in gently to create a disk, 
            about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the arepas(?)</strong>: Heat a thin layer of oil (oil is only needed to stop the arepas stiking to the pan) in a 
            large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the arepas and fry for about 6 minutes on both sides. 
            The arepas should get a dry fried exterior without getting overly brown. 
            Set on paper towels to drain and cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble</strong>: Cut the arepas in half and stuff with your fillings!</li>
    </ol>
